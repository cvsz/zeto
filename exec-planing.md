# Zeto Execution Plan

> Repository: `cvsz/zeto`
>
> Product target: **Zeto ProMeta Master Professional — Enterprise-grade Production Release**
>
> Baseline: v1.1.0 Facebook Page automation dashboard evolving into a complete AI Content Factory.
>
> Visual reverse-engineering note: the Z.A.R.V.I.S. requirements below are derived from the supplied screenshot and the recorded operator demo (`videoplayback.mp4`, ~251.84 s, 640×360, 30 fps). The authoritative reverse-engineering and implementation specification for **M12 — Z.A.R.V.I.S. Operator Runtime** is `docs/JARVIS-VIDEO-REVERSE-ENGINEERING.md`; this plan defers to it for state-transition semantics, contracts, schemas, event catalog, persistence, SLOs and acceptance criteria.

## 1. Mission

Zeto is a production-grade AI Content Factory and operator control plane executing the complete lifecycle:

```text
IDEATE → GENERATE → WRITE → APPROVE → SCHEDULE → PUBLISH → MONITOR → LEARN
```

The operating model is ProMeta/P-MASTER:

```text
ROLE → INPUTS → MODES → CONSTRAINTS → OUTPUT → SELF-CHECK → EVIDENCE → OPTIMIZE
```

Every major AI module supports:

- `PRODUCTION` — create the requested artifact.
- `OPS` — operate the capability continuously and safely.
- `OPTIMIZE` — learn from persisted metrics and improve future outputs.
- `REVIEW` — inspect evidence, policy, quality, cost, and reliability before promotion.

The existing Facebook implementation is the first production publishing adapter, not a disposable prototype.

## 2. Definition of Complete

The project is **not complete** because a feature exists in a mockup. Final completion requires all applicable items below:

- Production implementation, not placeholders.
- Authenticated and authorized API boundary.
- Durable persistence and restart safety.
- Typed/validated contracts.
- Idempotent mutations and side effects.
- Audit/provenance evidence.
- Unit, integration, API-contract, workflow, provider-fake, security and end-to-end tests.
- Observability: logs, metrics, traces and actionable alerts.
- Failure, retry, timeout, cancellation and recovery semantics.
- Security review and no known critical/high defects.
- Operator documentation and rollback/runbook coverage.
- CI green on protected `main`.
- Staging proof for the complete factory workflow.

No phase may be marked complete solely from documentation or UI appearance.

## 3. Current Baseline

Implemented baseline capabilities include:

- Dashboard and KPI overview.
- Facebook rich-text/photo publishing.
- Local post queue.
- Cron scheduler.
- Facebook Page feed management.
- Publish history.
- Settings UI and server-side configuration.
- Analytics and AI Generator UI entry points.
- Express backend and static SPA frontend.
- JSON-backed persistence.
- Google Drive media integration.

Current technical debt / gaps:

- Local JSON persistence instead of PostgreSQL.
- No durable distributed queue.
- No complete workflow/approval state machine.
- Legacy `/api` dominates; `/v1` migration is incomplete.
- No provider-neutral model router with production fallback evidence.
- No complete observability stack.
- Test coverage is newly bootstrapped and incomplete.
- No global policy engine for generated assets.
- Facebook is the only production publishing adapter.
- Legacy product references remain in parts of the UI/storage namespace.

## 4. Repository and Product Identity

Canonical identity:

```text
cvsz/zeto
@zeaz/zeto
Product name: Zeto
```

Rules:

- `Zeto` is the platform/product.
- `Facebook Adapter` is one integration inside Zeto.
- New code must not introduce `zfbauto` as a namespace.
- Legacy browser storage keys may be read temporarily for migration, but new writes use `zeto_*` keys.
- Repository, CI, deployment, badges, webhooks, GitHub Apps and environments must reference `cvsz/zeto`.

Migration checklist:

- [x] Canonical GitHub repository is `cvsz/zeto`.
- [x] Package is `@zeaz/zeto`.
- [x] README product identity uses Zeto.
- [x] Execution plan exists.
- [x] Runtime health service identity uses `zeto` on the implementation branch.
- [x] Replace remaining UI labels containing `zfbauto` or `FB Auto` when they refer to the product rather than the Facebook adapter.
- [x] Update clone URLs and documentation links after GitHub rename.
- [ ] Remove remaining stale product labels in UI/source/storage migration paths.
- [ ] Update CI/CD repository references, deployment targets, badges, webhooks, GitHub App configuration, and environment integrations.
- [ ] Preserve redirects from the old GitHub repository URL where GitHub provides them.
- [ ] Verify branch protection, environments and secrets.
- [ ] Verify deployment targets and external webhooks.

```

Architecture principles:

1. Provider secrets stay server-side.
2. Every mutation is authenticated, authorized, validated, auditable and idempotent.
3. Platform-specific publishing code remains behind adapters.
4. AI generation remains provider-neutral with bounded fallback and cost policy.
5. Human approval remains possible even with `AUTO_PILOT=true`.
6. Every async job has ownership, retry, timeout, cancellation and failure semantics.
7. Every generated artifact records provenance/version/cost/model route.
8. Public application APIs converge under `/v1`.
9. UI telemetry must be derived from persisted/runtime state; never fabricate KPI values.
10. Autonomous remediation may prepare changes, but release promotion remains evidence-gated.

## Phase 6A / M11 — Z.A.R.V.I.S. Neural Operator View

**Z.A.R.V.I.S.** = **Zeto Autonomous Runtime Virtual Intelligence System** — the live system twin / operator control surface for Zeto.

> **M12 — Z.A.R.V.I.S. Operator Runtime** (the agent/voice/computer-use runtime, distinct from this M11 operator view) is specified in `docs/JARVIS-VIDEO-REVERSE-ENGINEERING.md`, which is the source of truth for its state-transition table, contracts, schemas, event catalog, persistence model, SLOs and acceptance matrix.

### Visual source and intent

The supplied screenshot shows a dark operator workstation with a large display presenting a side-profile Z.A.R.V.I.S. head rendered as thousands of cyan/gold particles, with a bright energy/core point and dense control surfaces around it. Zeto will implement this as a **live system twin**, not a cosmetic animation.

### Current implementation slice

- [x] Standalone `/zarvis` operator surface.
- [x] Canvas point-cloud zarvis visualization without external 3D dependency.
- [x] Live backend-derived queue/approval/schedule/history telemetry.
- [x] Authenticated `/v1/zarvis/state` endpoint.
- [x] Module/agent matrix for M01-M10/M11 operational state.
- [x] Runtime Node/uptime/scheduler visibility.
- [x] Unit test for operator-state derivation.

### Full-stack target

Frontend:

- WebGL/Canvas renderer supporting desktop/tablet/mobile.
- Side-profile point cloud, neural core, orbital/voice-wave effects and scan telemetry.
- 30/60 FPS adaptive rendering with reduced-motion fallback.
- Keyboard navigation and screen-reader state summary.
- Agent/workflow topology view.
- Drill-down from head regions/nodes into workflow, provider, queue, approval and incident panels.
- Operator command palette.
- Incident mode that visually distinguishes degraded modules without relying on color alone.
- Historical playback of operator snapshots.

Backend:

- `/v1/zarvis/state` — current system twin snapshot.
- `/v1/zarvis/timeline` — historical snapshots.
- `/v1/zarvis/modules/:id` — module detail and health evidence.
- `/v1/zarvis/commands` — admin-only allowlisted operator commands.
- Server-Sent Events or WebSocket transport for live events after durable event foundation exists.
- State sourced from PostgreSQL/workflows/metrics/alerts/providers, never random dashboard data.
- Snapshot provenance, sequence numbers and correlation IDs.

Operator commands must be allowlisted and RBAC-protected, including:

- Pause/resume AUTO-PILOT.
- Pause/resume scheduler.
- Retry/cancel a selected failed job.
- Open approval item.
- Trigger health diagnostics.
- Activate emergency publishing kill switch.

No arbitrary shell execution is exposed through the UI.

Z.A.R.V.I.S. semantics:

- `confidence` = derived operational confidence, with documented formula/version.
- `neural_load` = normalized queue/worker/provider pressure.
- `focus` = highest-priority current operator concern.
- `alert_level` = deterministic rules from incidents/approvals/failures/SLOs.
- Head/particle animation reacts to real state but does not redefine the state.

Video reconciliation pass, once the source video is uploaded:

- Extract key frames and interaction timeline.
- Inventory every visible panel/control/transition.
- Reproduce interaction hierarchy without copying protected branding/assets.
- Map each interaction to a real Zeto API/domain capability.
- Add missing animation states, gestures and transitions.
- Add visual-regression tests for representative viewport states.

Exit criteria:

- Operator view remains useful with animation disabled.
- Every displayed operational metric has a source and timestamp.
- Stale/disconnected states are visibly indicated.
- Viewer cannot invoke mutations.
- Admin commands are audited/idempotent where applicable.
- 1-hour soak test has no unbounded memory growth.
- Rendering meets performance budget on supported targets.

## Phase 6B / M12 — Z.A.R.V.I.S. Operator Runtime

**Source of truth:** `docs/JARVIS-VIDEO-REVERSE-ENGINEERING.md` — the master reverse-engineering and implementation specification for the M12 runtime. This phase implements the runtime on top of the M11 operator view (`Phase 6A`).

**Z.A.R.V.I.S.** = **Zeto Autonomous Runtime Virtual Intelligence System** — the agent/voice/computer-use operator runtime, distinct from the M11 operator view.

### Scope

- Session/event loop with canonical event catalog (spec §10).
- Operator state machine with guarded transitions — `IDLE → LISTENING → TRANSCRIBING → THINKING → PLANNING → AWAITING_APPROVAL → EXECUTING → VERIFYING → SPEAKING → IDLE`, with `RECOVERING`/`REAUTHORIZING` for recovery, `PAUSED` for resumable interruption, and terminal `FAILED / CANCELLED / EMERGENCY_STOPPED` (terminal states have no outbound transitions; emergency stop is immediate and never shares pause semantics) — including timeout, retry, cancellation, checkpoint and recovery semantics (spec §3.3).
- Intent router, planner, skill/agent registries, tool gateway, executor, observer/verifier (spec §6).
- Voice plane: push-to-talk/VAD, streaming STT/TTS, barge-in, latency budgets and fallback matrix (spec §5).
- Computer-use adapters (Browser/Desktop/File/Shell/Application) behind typed contracts with observe→decide→act→verify loops (spec §7).
- Command Stream, Sequence Builder, approval drawer, mobile pairing, onboarding (spec §2, §4).
- Audit, memory boundaries, persistence model, observability/SLOs and recovery/checkpoint model (spec §8, §11–§13).

### Current implementation slice

- [ ] M12 contracts + operator state machine + event stream (spec §3.3, §9, §10).
- [ ] Command Stream and orb wired to real events.
- [ ] Sequence Builder persistence and execution.
- [ ] Skill/tool registries and policy gateway.
- [ ] Browser automation adapter + verifier.
- [ ] Desktop/application adapters + verifier.
- [ ] Voice STT/TTS + push-to-talk + barge-in.
- [ ] Mobile pairing.
- [ ] Advanced autonomous mode with bounded budgets and approvals.
- [ ] Full security/E2E/soak/recovery evidence.

### Non-negotiable invariants (spec §8)

- Deny-by-default tool permissions; approval required for destructive, external side-effect, credential, financial, publication and privilege-changing actions.
- Observed browser/screen content is **untrusted data** — it can never grant tools or change policy (prompt-injection defense).
- Every action carries provenance: `session_id`, `plan_id`, `step_id`, `risk`, `approval`, `idempotency_key` and verification evidence.
- Secrets redacted in UI, logs, screenshots and model context; emergency stop revokes ephemeral grants.
- No raw audio persistence by default; retention requires explicit policy.

### Exit criteria (mapped to spec §14.1 acceptance matrix)

- All state-machine transitions in spec §3.3 covered by tests; timeout/retry/cancellation/recovery paths green.
- Permission-bypass and prompt-injection suites green; approval matrix enforced.
- Voice latency SLOs met in staging; fallback matrix exercised.
- E2E: voice/text command → plan → approval → tool execution → verification → spoken/UI result passes in staging.
- Crash mid-plan resumes without duplicate side effects (idempotency proven).
- 12-hour soak: zero unrecoverable failures and no unbounded memory growth.
- Audit completeness and QR-token expiry/replay tests green.

## Phase 7 — M09 Orchestration and AUTO-PILOT

Canonical chain:

```text
M01[OPS]
  → M02-M05[PRODUCTION]
  → M10[QA]
  → approval gate

- Step ownership/status.
- Retry/compensation.
- Cancellation/timeouts.
- Idempotent side effects.
- Typed artifact passing.
- Stuck-job detection.

AUTO-PILOT always obeys QA threshold, platform permission, budget, frequency cap, claims/copyright policy, emergency kill switch and audit logging.

Exit criteria:

- End-to-end workflow requires no manual data copying.
- Failed steps resume without replaying completed side effects.
- Operator can stop autonomous publishing immediately.

## Phase 8 — Multi-Platform Publishing

- Distributed traces for workflow runs.
- Alerts on availability, error rate, stuck jobs, queue depth, DB saturation and provider degradation.

Performance:

- Load baseline for API and workers.
- Queue throughput benchmark.
- Publish/generation latency objectives.
- Browser performance budget.
- Z.A.R.V.I.S. view memory/FPS budget.

## 9. Continuous 30-Minute Engineering Verification Loop

Zeto uses a repository-owned GitHub Actions schedule every 30 minutes for **verification and maintenance evidence**.

The loop must:

1. Checkout the latest target branch.
2. Install dependencies reproducibly.
3. Run lint.
4. Run full unit/integration tests available in the repository.
5. Run build/syntax validation.
6. Run high-severity dependency audit.
7. Build the container.
8. Inspect outdated dependencies without automatically accepting breaking upgrades.
9. Publish an evidence artifact/report for the run.
10. Fail loudly when any gate regresses.

Important engineering rule:

- The 30-minute workflow may verify, inspect, report and prepare safe maintenance metadata.
- It must **not** blindly rewrite application code, auto-merge arbitrary AI changes, rotate secrets, modify production credentials or promote releases without evidence gates.
- Automated implementation agents, when added, work on isolated branches/PRs and must pass the same suite before merge.

This design preserves the user's requested continuous update/upgrade/review cadence without converting production into an uncontrolled self-modifying system.

## 10. Upgrade / Update / Implementation Loop

For every vertical slice:

```text
AUDIT
→ PLAN
→ IMPLEMENT
→ SELF-REVIEW
→ LINT
→ UNIT TEST
→ INTEGRATION TEST
→ API CONTRACT TEST
→ SECURITY TEST
→ CONTAINER TEST
→ PERFORMANCE CHECK (when relevant)
→ REVIEW DIFF
→ PR
→ CI
→ REPAIR FAILURES
→ MERGE WHEN GREEN
→ NEXT SLICE
```

Upgrade policy:

- Patch/minor dependencies may be proposed automatically after compatibility checks.
- Major upgrades require migration review.
- Never bypass failing tests to obtain a green build.
- Never suppress security findings without documented risk acceptance.
- Every release change has rollback notes.

## 11. Full Test Suite Target

Mandatory categories by final release:

- Unit tests.
- Repository/database tests.
- Migration tests.
- API integration tests.
- API schema/contract tests.
- Auth/RBAC tests.
- Idempotency tests.
- Workflow state-machine tests.
- Approval bypass/negative tests.
- Provider fake/timeout/rate-limit tests.
- Publishing duplicate prevention tests.
- Object-storage tests.
- Event/outbox tests.
- Security tests including SSRF/upload/rate-limit/secret leakage.
- Browser/UI smoke tests.
- Z.A.R.V.I.S. view state/render smoke tests.
- End-to-end factory workflow tests.
- Backup/restore test.
- Rollback test.
- Load/performance baseline.
- Soak tests for workers and operator UI.

## 12. Release Evidence Matrix

A release candidate must attach evidence for:

## 13. Final Release Exit Criteria

`ProMeta Master Professional Enterprise Final Release` may be declared complete only when:

- Zero known critical/high security defects.
- Protected `main` is green.
- PostgreSQL is the production source of truth.
- M01-M11 applicable capabilities are implemented and tested.
- Database migrations are forward-safe with documented rollback strategy.
- Publishing duplication tests pass.
- Approval bypass tests pass.
- Provider-secret leakage tests pass.
- Full end-to-end factory workflow passes in staging.
- AUTO-PILOT kill switch is proven.
- Z.A.R.V.I.S. operator view reflects real system state and degrades safely when disconnected.
- Multi-platform adapters meet the shared contract for enabled release platforms.
- Observability/SLO alerts are operational.
- Backup restore and incident exercises have passed.
- Release artifacts are reproducible and signed/traceable as configured.
- Operational runbook, incident procedures and release rollback instructions exist.

Until all applicable evidence is present, status remains **in progress**, even if feature development is functionally broad.
