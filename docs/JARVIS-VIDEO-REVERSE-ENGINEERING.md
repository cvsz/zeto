# Z.A.R.V.I.S. Operator Runtime — Reverse-Engineering & Implementation Specification

**Status:** Master spec · Source of truth for **M12 — Z.A.R.V.I.S. Operator Runtime** (`exec-planing.md` references this document).
**Source inspected:** uploaded `videoplayback.mp4`, duration ~251.84 seconds, 640×360, 30fps. Brand surface observed: "Brahma AI".
**Acronym:** Z.A.R.V.I.S. = **Zeto Autonomous Runtime Virtual Intelligence System**.

This document records visible product behavior from the supplied recording and translates it into Zeto requirements. It does not claim hidden implementation details that cannot be observed from the recording. §1.3 holds a coarse timeline-evidence pass derived from automated frame extraction + OCR of the source recording: each row separates observed text from inference, and nothing is fabricated.

> **Reference-media policy:** the source recording is committed at `media/zarvis-ref.mp4` (SHA-256 `9f93ebdd…`). Future reference media should be stored via **Git LFS or artifact/object storage with an immutable SHA-256 manifest** to avoid permanent repo-history growth; replacing or re-encoding the reference requires updating the SHA-256 above and re-running frame extraction + OCR.

### 1.2 Observed UI / interaction inventory

The recording shows a dark desktop AI operator application with a persistent command-center layout. Observed capabilities and surfaces:

1. Central animated AI orb / neural status visualization.
2. Mode controls across the top, including chat/voice-oriented and advanced/automation-oriented modes.
3. Left navigation with Dashboard and Settings.
4. Right-side Command Stream showing executed/observed actions and system messages.
5. Right-side Sequence Builder for composing and saving multi-step command sequences.
6. Command input bar with Send action and suggestion/shortcut controls.
7. Runtime telemetry such as CPU, RAM, network status and camera state.
8. Desktop automation demonstrated by opening/controlling another application (presentation software).
9. Browser automation demonstrated by navigating/interacting with a web page.
10. Computer/typing intent shown in command-stream examples.
11. Mobile pairing flow using a QR code and connection information.
12. Initial setup/onboarding flow for initializing the assistant and account/API configuration.
13. Advanced/automation modes surfaced as first-class operating modes.
14. Error/failure messages are visible in the command stream rather than being silently swallowed.
15. Dedicated **CAMERA PREVIEW** panel beside the command center (observed ~01:35–01:45).
16. Orb idle surface labelled **JARVIS CORE / WAITING FOR INPUT** with a "Ask Jarvis anything in STUDY mode…" prompt (~01:40–01:50).

### 1.3 Timeline evidence

**Pass type:** coarse evidence pass — 25 frames sampled on a 10-second grid (`ffmpeg` frame extraction) + `tesseract` OCR of `media/zarvis-ref.mp4`. This is **not** a frame-accurate scene map: interactions shorter than ~10 s, transitions, modal opens, clicks, and voice-state changes can be missed.

Rows are **independent observations** from the grid frames listed in `Frame(s)` — they are **not** a partition of the timeline. Overlapping windows (e.g., 01:20–01:40, 01:35–01:45, 01:40–01:50) simply mean the same frames informed multiple observations; downstream tooling must not treat them as mutually exclusive segments.

Each row separates **Observed** (visually confirmed from the frame) from **OCR text** (raw extracted text, noisy) from **Inference** (interpretation of the above). Confidence: **High** = OCR text matches a known surface; **Medium** = partial/weak OCR; **Low** = no OCR text, inference only. Medium/Low rows require human visual confirmation against the 25-frame contact sheet before being promoted to evidence.

> **Coverage status:** coarse evidence pass only. Sub-10 s detail and all Medium/Low rows require human visual confirmation against the contact sheet (25-frame montage) before promotion to evidence; a frame-accurate scene-by-scene pass on re-watch would upgrade this from coarse to full reconstruction.
>
> **Provenance rule:** do not fabricate timecodes or behaviors. Every row is derived from the actual recording via `ffmpeg` frame extraction + `tesseract` OCR; rows with no OCR text are marked inference (Low) and must not be treated as positive observations.

### 2.3 Orb motion & animation states

| Orb state    | Trigger                                 | Animation                     | Reduced-motion fallback |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| IDLE         | No active session                       | Slow pulse                    | Static glyph            |
| LISTENING    | Mic active / VAD open                   | Rings expand, waveform        | "LISTENING" label       |
| TRANSCRIBING | Speech being decoded                    | Streaming tick                | Spinner                 |
| THINKING     | Planner running                         | Orbit speed-up                | "THINKING" label        |
| EXECUTING    | Tool running                            | Directed pulse                | Progress bar            |
| VERIFYING    | Postcondition check                     | Scan sweep                    | "VERIFYING" label       |
| SPEAKING     | TTS active                              | Speaking bars                 | Waveform icon           |
| DEGRADED     | Partial failure                         | Amber/red tint, non-color cue | Text + icon             |
| FAILED       | Canonical `FAILED` state (hard failure) | Shake/red flash + message     | Text + icon             |

Every animation is derived from real operator state (§3.3); the orb never fabricates status. Orb visual states are **presentations** of the canonical operator state machine — `ERROR` is not a runtime state; all failures map to canonical `FAILED` and are styled separately.

### 2.4 Responsive, error and empty states

- Breakpoints: desktop ≥1280 (full 3-column), tablet 768–1279 (2-column), mobile <768 (stacked; command stream collapses to drawer).
- Empty states: command stream ("No commands yet"), sequence list ("No saved sequences"), transcript ("Say or type a command").
- Error states: visible in command stream with `error` result and recovery hint; never silently swallowed (video observation 14).

### 3.2 Layers

1. **Session / event loop** — owns the operator session, correlates all events via `session_id`.
2. **Intent router** — maps text/speech to typed intents; resolves ambiguity.
3. **Planner** — produces typed, inspectable plans (never free-form).
4. **Policy engine** — deny-by-default grants, approval routing, budget/frequency/rate limits, kill switch.
5. **Executor** — runs plan steps through the tool gateway with timeout, cancellation, retry.
6. **Adapters** — Browser/Desktop/File/Shell/Application behind typed contracts (§7).
7. **Observer / verifier** — confirms postconditions before success is reported.
8. **Audit + memory + events** — immutable provenance, bounded memory, canonical event stream.

### 3.3 Operator state machine (transition table)

**State groups** — every transition rule references these sets; there are **no bare `any` rules**:

```text
IDLE
ACTIVE_STATES   = LISTENING, TRANSCRIBING, THINKING, PLANNING, AWAITING_APPROVAL,
                  EXECUTING, VERIFYING, SPEAKING, DEGRADED
RECOVERY_STATES = RECOVERING, REAUTHORIZING
PAUSED           (interruptible, resumable)
TERMINAL_STATES = FAILED, CANCELLED, EMERGENCY_STOPPED
NON_TERMINAL     = IDLE ∪ ACTIVE_STATES ∪ RECOVERY_STATES ∪ {PAUSED}
```

**Determinism rules:**

- `TERMINAL_STATES` have **no outbound transitions**. Leaving a terminal state requires a **new session generation** (`session_id` + `generation`), never a revert to a prior state.
- `EMERGENCY_STOPPED` is reachable from any `NON_TERMINAL` state but **only** for genuine safety interrupts: emergency stop, global kill switch, safety interlock. Ordinary cancellation, operator rejection, plan timeout and re-authorization failure route to `CANCELLED` — never to `EMERGENCY_STOPPED`.
- Every transition is audited (`from, to, trigger, actor, session_id, plan_id, step_id, ts`).

**Checkpoint / resume contract** (persisted per session; the runtime never guesses the resume target):

```json
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "generation": 3,
  "state": "PAUSED",
  "resume_state": "VERIFYING",
  "checkpoint_id": "...",
  "plan_id": "...",
  "step_id": "...",
  "attempt": 2,
  "grants_revoked": true
}
```

Rules: `state: PAUSED` persists `resume_state` from the pre-pause state; `RECOVERING`/`REAUTHORIZING` persist the same contract so a restart resolves the exact resume target; `grants_revoked` gates grant re-issuance (only on approval).

**Semantics:** checkpointing at plan-step granularity enables resume from `PAUSED`/crash (§13). `FAILED`/`CANCELLED`/`EMERGENCY_STOPPED` run cleanup: revoke ephemeral grants, cancel in-flight tools, emit terminal event. `EMERGENCY_STOPPED` additionally latches the kill switch; leaving it requires a **new session generation** with explicit restart and re-authorization. Re-authorization failure is ordinary cancellation (`CANCELLED`), never an emergency.

## 4. Command & Input Planes

### 4.1 Command taxonomy

| Category    | Examples                                                                                           | Risk        | Approval required                               |

### 4.2 Command stream event

```json
{
  "id": "evt_...",
  "session_id": "...",
  "plan_id": "...",
  "step_id": "...",
  "ts": "ISO-8601",
  "actor": "operator|zarvis|policy|system",
  "intent": "publish",
  "tool": "facebook_publish",
  "target": "https://...",
  "risk": "high",
  "approval": "approved|denied|not_required",
  "result": "ok|error|blocked|cancelled",
  "duration_ms": 0,
  "correlation_id": "..."
}
```

### 4.3 Sequence Builder

```json
{
  "id": "seq_...",
  "name": "morning-brief",
  "mode": "chat|operator|automation",
  "steps": [
    { "id": "s1", "intent": "fetch_queue", "args": {} },
    { "id": "s2", "intent": "summarize", "args": { "input": "s1.result" } },
    { "id": "s3", "intent": "speak", "args": { "text": "s2.result" } }
  ],
  "dryRun": false
}
```

Execution semantics: sequential steps; step outputs addressable (`s<N>.result`); each step idempotent via `idempotency_key`; partial failure stops and offers resume; save/run/dry-run supported; replay after failure is allowed only with operator confirmation for high-risk steps.

## 5. Voice Plane

- Browser microphone capture; VAD and push-to-talk modes; streaming STT adapter; barge-in/interruption support; streaming TTS adapter; provider-neutral STT/TTS interfaces with local-provider option.
- **Latency budgets:** STT first-token ≤ 2 s; TTS first-audio ≤ 1.5 s; end-to-end voice command → plan start ≤ 5 s (P95).
- **Fallback matrix:**

| Failure               | Fallback                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| STT provider down     | Secondary STT provider, then text-only input |
| TTS provider down     | Secondary TTS, then silent text reply        |
| Mic permission denied | Text-only with visible notice                |
| Barge-in unreliable   | Disable barge-in for the session             |

- No raw audio persistence by default; retention requires explicit policy.

---

## 6. Agent & Orchestration Plane

### 6.1 Intent router

Classify utterances to typed intents with confidence; below threshold → clarifying question; unsupported intent → visible "cannot do" message with suggestions (never silent).

### 6.2 Planner

```json
{
  "plan_id": "...",
  "session_id": "...",
  "intent": "...",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_id": "p1",
      "tool": "browser_navigate",
      "args": {},
      "risk": "low",
      "depends_on": []
    }
  ],
  "policy_verdict": "approved|approval_required|denied",
  "estimated_cost": 0,
  "created_at": "ISO-8601"
}
```

### 6.3 Skill manifest (registry)

```json
{
  "skill_id": "queue-brief",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "...",
  "capabilities": ["queue.read", "speak"],
  "entry": { "intent": "queue_brief" },
  "permissions": ["queue:read"],
  "max_cost_per_run": 0.1,
  "approval": "none"
}
```

### 6.4 Agent registry & delegation

Bounded delegation: parent agent may hand a sub-task to a registered child agent only within policy; child executes under inherited grants, emits its own provenance chain, and returns typed results. Delegation depth and fan-out are capped.

### 6.5 Tool gateway

Deny-by-default; explicit grants scoped by user/workspace/session; tool schemas enforced (zod-style validation); every call carries `session_id, plan_id, step_id, risk, approval, idempotency_key`.

### 6.6 Executor

Timeout, cancellation and retry per §3.3; graceful cancel propagates to adapters; orphaned tool calls are reconciled on session resume.

### 6.7 Observer / verifier

Each step declares postconditions; verifier confirms them before success; failure evidence stored with the step.

### 6.8 Memory boundaries

| Store    | Scope                         | Consent           | Retention        |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Working  | Current session context       | Implicit          | Session end      |
| Episodic | Prior session summaries       | Explicit opt-in   | Configurable TTL |
| Durable  | User-approved facts/sequences | Explicit approval | Until revoked    |

## 7. Computer-Use Plane

All adapters are typed and sandboxed — never raw uncontrolled shell/browser access.

**Observation → action loop:** observe (a11y tree/screen) → decide (policy-checked) → act → verify → record evidence. Observed browser/screen content is **untrusted data**: it can never grant tools or change policy (prompt-injection defense).

**Tool contract (request/response):**

```json

## 8. Safety & Security Boundary

### 8.1 Mandatory controls (unchanged from observed baseline)

- Deny-by-default tool permissions; explicit grants scoped by user/workspace/session.
- Approval required for destructive, external side-effect, credential, financial, publication and privilege-changing actions.
- Domain/application allowlists for autonomous execution.
- Secret redaction in UI, logs, screenshots and model context.
- Prompt-injection defense: observed content is untrusted data, never authority.
- Sandboxed shell/filesystem execution; rate, cost and step limits.
- Emergency stop transitions to the terminal `EMERGENCY_STOPPED` state: cancels active plans, revokes ephemeral grants immediately, and requires explicit restart and re-authorization before new sessions are accepted.
- Pairing QR tokens short-lived, single-use, bound to an authenticated operator session.

## 11. Persistence Model

Entities: `operator_commands, operator_events, operator_plans, operator_plan_steps, operator_sequences, operator_sequence_steps, skill_manifests, agent_manifests, tool_grants, tool_executions, verification_evidence, voice_sessions, pairing_tokens`.

| Entity                                              | Key relations                   | Indexes                    | Retention                      |

| `tool_executions`                                   | N:1 step                        | `(idempotency_key)` unique | 90 d                           |

Audit events are append-only; all others are mutable operational state. Retention is configurable per deployment.

## 12. Observability & SLOs

**Metrics:** operator sessions, commands/sec, intent-resolution rate, plan completion rate, tool success/failure/retry counts, approval latency, voice latency, cost/run, pairing success, incident count.
**Traces:** one trace per command: input → intent → plan → step → tool → verify → response, with `session_id`/`plan_id`/`step_id` as span attributes.
**SLOs (target):**

| SLO                             | Target     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Command → plan start (text)     | ≤ 2 s P95  |
| Voice first-token               | ≤ 2 s P95  |
| Tool success rate (allowlisted) | ≥ 99%      |
| Plan completion (no incident)   | ≥ 98%      |
| Approval decision latency       | ≤ 30 s P95 |
| Operator surface availability   | ≥ 99.9%    |
| Secret leakage incidents        | 0          |

---

## 13. Recovery Model

- **Crash:** session state reconstructed from `operator_events` + the persisted checkpoint contract (§3.3); the runtime enters `RECOVERING`, validates the checkpoint, reacquires the lease, and resumes the persisted `resume_state`. Invalid checkpoints route to `FAILED`.
- **Reconnect:** SSE/WebSocket resume with last `sequence_id`; UI replays command stream from persisted events.
- **Checkpoint:** plan-step granularity; resume from last verified step; unverified steps re-verify before continuation. The `state`/`resume_state`/`checkpoint_id` contract (§3.3) is persisted — the runtime never guesses the resume target.
- **Re-authorization:** `PAUSED → REAUTHORIZING`; granted → `RECOVERING` → prior state; denied/expired → `CANCELLED` (ordinary cancellation, not an emergency).
- **Pause vs emergency stop:** `PAUSED` resumes through `REAUTHORIZING`/`RECOVERING` to the prior resumable state; `EMERGENCY_STOPPED` is terminal — leaving it requires a **new session generation** with explicit restart + re-authorization.
- **Dead-letter:** steps failing past retry budget land in dead-letter with incident raised; operator may retry, cancel, or quarantine.
- **Backup/restore:** covered by `scripts/backup.sh` + `scripts/verify-backup.sh`; operator tables included in restore drills.

---

## 14. Testing & Release Evidence

- State-machine unit tests (every transition in §3.3), including terminal-state isolation (no outbound transitions) and kill-switch determinism (routes only to `EMERGENCY_STOPPED`).
- Planner schema/property tests.
- Tool permission and approval-bypass tests.
- Prompt-injection tests using malicious browser/page content.
- Browser/desktop provider-fake tests.
- Cancellation/timeout/retry/idempotency tests.
- Voice interruption and reconnect tests.
- Sequence replay and partial-failure tests.
- QR token expiry/replay tests.
- Audit completeness tests.
- E2E: voice/text command → plan → approval → tool execution → verification → spoken/UI result.
- Soak tests for long operator sessions and streaming reconnect.

## 16. Definition of Done

M12 is complete only when the visual operator is backed by real state, all tool execution passes through policy/approval, failures are visible and recoverable, actions are auditable and verifiable, tests cover permission bypass/prompt injection/cancellation/replay, and the full voice/text-to-action workflow passes the §14.1 acceptance matrix and staging release gates.
